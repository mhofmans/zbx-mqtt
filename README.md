# ZBXMQTT
A simple, yet functional, way to integrate devices that support MQTT to your Zabbix Server.
This script does not contain broker authentication. (I will add a second script including authentication soon)

# MQTT Broker
Make sure you have a MQTT Broker running. <a href="https://mosquitto.org">Mosquitto</a> is recommended.
